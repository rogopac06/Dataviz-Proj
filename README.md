## A visual analysis of more than 2000 chocolate bars tasted by the members of the Manhattan Chocolate Society.
Every year the Manhattan Chocolate Society taste and review hundreds of chocolate bars, produced all over the world.

For every bar tasted various info are reported: ingredients, beans origin, overrall taste, smell, consistency, cocoa percentage and, among others, their personal rating.

Those data sparked our curiosity and we embarked on a journey which revolved around 3 major questions:

1) where do cocoa beans mostly come from?
2) is there a "perfect" mix of ingredients for a chocolate bar? 
3) what are the most common flavors in all those bars?


## The infographic
We tried to answer our questions with an infographic made of 4 visualizations:

1. **Where do cocoa beans come from** - *is mainly an interactive one and can be accessed at [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matteo.lanzillotti/viz/CocoaBeansMap/Dashboard6?publish=yes "Where do cocoa beans come from - Interactive viz")*
2. **Most memorable characteristics** - *focuses on the bars' most common flavors*
3. **The perfect recipe** - *employed a cool upset plot*
4. **Cocoa percentage distribution** - *because our professor loved violin plot* 

## The data
We used 2 dataset from Kaggle:

1. [Chocolate dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soroushghaderi/chocolate-bar-2020 "Chocolate bar dataset")
2. [Geo data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state "Lat and Long dataset")
